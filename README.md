# e_mess

This repository contains the Android application for the e-Mess POS systems.

The application is built using the Flutter framework therefore it is compatible with multiple platforms.

## Backend Implementation Status

**This application currently does NOT have a backend implementation.**

The app is a frontend-only Flutter application with:
- Hardcoded menu items and prices displayed in the UI
- No API integration or network communication
- No database connectivity
- No authentication or user management backend
- No order processing or payment backend services

For a complete POS system, a backend would need to be developed separately to handle:
- User authentication and authorization
- Menu management (CRUD operations for food items)
- Order processing and tracking
- Payment processing
- Transaction history
- User account management
- Inventory management

## Getting Started
